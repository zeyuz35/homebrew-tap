# Homebrew Taps

Collection of various taps that I use.

Currently this is mainly for various commercial solvers that don't have "proper" package installers.
- COPT
- MOSEK
- GUROBI

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install zeyuz35/homebrew-tap/<formula>`

Or `brew tap zeyuz35/homebrew-tap` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or, in a `brew bundle` `Brewfile`:

```ruby
tap "zeyuz35/homebrew-tap"
brew "<formula>"
```

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
